# Lung Cancer Mortality Prediction Project

## Overview

I am excited to announce my latest project on predicting lung cancer mortality rates. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle's trending collections, this project aims to uncover critical insights into lung cancer and its contributing factors.

## Key Insights

1. **Middle-Aged Vulnerability:** Lung cancer predominantly affects individuals aged 45-60.
2. **Gender Equality:** The impact of lung cancer is almost equal among males and females.
3. **Asthma Correlation:** People with asthma have a higher likelihood of developing lung cancer.
4. **Smoking Risks:** Smokers are at a significantly higher risk of lung cancer.

## Project Details

- **Data Source:** Kaggle (randomly selected from trending datasets)
- **Tools & Techniques:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Logistic Regression, OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler
- **Objective:** To leverage machine learning to predict lung cancer mortality and provide actionable insights for healthcare strategies.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lung-cancer-mortality-prediction.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the project:**
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## Results

This project highlights the importance of early detection and the need for targeted awareness and prevention strategies. The insights derived from the data can help in developing better healthcare policies and interventions.
